TODO:

to be implemented:
- extend copyfrom functionality to copy between 2 active databases
- better copyfrom; append to table, little different fields
- global cache for dbfs, indexes
- flush method to commit buffers to disk
- required field checking
- demo needs master/detail example
- documentation needs expression index examples
- val function for indexes
- retrieve temporary filenames used in restructuretable

needs fixing:
- lazarus projects need unit ideintf when dropping tdbf on forum
- unix character set conversion is a mess
- parser result string > 100 only for index
- check paged cache flushing, recordcount in cache
- adding records without doing CancelRange causes assertion violation
- adding records while filter active causes autoinc fields not to be filled in
- exception safe freeing of items in TOCollection.FreeItem

bug reports:
