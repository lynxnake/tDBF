TODO:

to be implemented:
- extend copyfrom functionality to copy between 2 active databases
- better copyfrom; append to table, little different fields
- investigate possibility fixing invalid field types to character field type
- restructuretable - delete backup file / enter backup filename
- global cache for dbfs, indexes
- flush method to commit buffers to disk
- required field checking
- demo needs master/detail example
- documentation needs expression index examples
- documentation needs general database explanation
- filter supports wildcards 'FIELD = "bla*"'

needs fixing:
- parser result string > 100 only for index
- check paged cache flushing, recordcount in cache
- adding records without doing CancelRange causes assertion violation
- adding records while filter active causes autoinc fields not to be filled in
- exception safe freeing of items in TOCollection.FreeItem
- packtable in-memory table
