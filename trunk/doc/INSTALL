To install in the IDE
=====================

Delphi / C++ Builder
--------------------

1. Choose File -> Open Project
2. Select the runtime package for your version of Delphi / C++ Builder (see packages.txt)
3. Compile
4. Open the design package, and install it
   (Note BCB 4 and Delphi 3 and 4 don't have run/designtime separation)
5. All done.

Lazarus
-------

The TDbf component is included in the FPC distribution. This is easiest to use:
1. Project -> Open project
2. Select the dbflaz.lpk in lazarus/components/tdbf/
3. Install (note that this needs recompilation of lazarus)

If you have downloaded a seperate version of TDbf, then you need to remove the
TDbf units from the FPC distribution first, because lazarus will detect them,
and while compiling, this will give problems. They're usually located in 
fpc/units/fcl/dbf*.{o,ppu}. Then follow the procedure above, but selecting the
package included in the tdbf directory: tdbf_l.lpk.
