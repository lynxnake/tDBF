Release Checklist
=================

This file lists some of the things you should consider when releasing a new version of TDbf


Version
-------

Determine the version number
- The version number is 3 parts, each part is 1 digit, eg. 7.0.0
- If the third digit is 0, it is not displayed to the user and should not be used in user documentation, eg. 7.0
- Update the TDBF_MAJOR_VERSION, TDBF_MINOR_VERSION and TDBF_SUB_MINOR_VERSION constants 


Demo
----

If there are significant features added, change the demo to show them


Documentation
-------------

Document your changes
- Document changes to the code in doc/history.txt
- Document changes to the functionality in doc/tdbf.odt, update the Contents section and export to doc/tdbf.pdf (this can be done in OpenOffice)
- Document changes to the functionality of the demo in demo/history.txt


Testing
-------

Test your changes on as many compiler versions as you are able to
